I introduced some new topics that weren't fully explained (like space complexity and memory usage) in the previous video which we will get to when we start coding things. However, I have structured it this way so that you understand why these two algorithms are used as we go through the next couple of videos. I will intrude the bottom link later on as well when you have more of an understanding of how these algorithms work, but if you're extra curious, you can see this resource for an explanation of the difference in memory usage. If you skip this, I will still provide it in the later parts of this section:<br><br><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9844193/what-is-the-time-and-space-complexity-of-a-breadth-first-and-depth-first-tree-tr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9844193/what-is-the-time-and-space-complexity-of-a-breadth-first-and-depth-first-tree-tr</a></p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
