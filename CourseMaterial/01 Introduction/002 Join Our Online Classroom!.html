In the spirit of keeping the course as useful as possible for employment this year, we are introducing a Discord online classroom&nbsp;where you can:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>-&nbsp;Introduce yourself&nbsp;<br>- Ask the community questions&nbsp; <br>- Get help with exercises&nbsp;<br>- Meet other students around the world&nbsp; <br>- Learn how to&nbsp;answer questions&nbsp;<br>- Learn from each other</strong></p><p>Many students have said this is the best part of the course as you will feel like you are learning in a classroom rather than by yourself in front of&nbsp;a computer. I know it isn't for everybody, but being able to ask questions and help others when they have questions is the best way to learn. <strong>The Discord&nbsp;community should give you faster replies to your questions from the community, while learning another valuable tool of a programmer. </strong><br></p><p><strong>Once there,&nbsp;you can sign up and click on different channels to explore different topics.&nbsp; If you are new to Discord we have written up a quick tutorial for you right </strong><a href="https://zerotomastery.io/community/discord" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong><br><br>I'll see you inside!!!<br></p><p>- Andrei <br></p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/9KxUUxt7Vd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>CLICK HERE TO JOIN NOW</strong></a></p><p><br></p><figure><img height="215" src="https://i.ibb.co/F8hP3KR/2021-03-09-13-54-24-8b2ccf9752b026233a7ebd195d792254.png" width="213"></figure><p><br></p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
