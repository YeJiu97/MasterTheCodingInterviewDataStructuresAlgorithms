I have picked this way of doing things since it would be most familiar with most languages. If you would like to be a little bit more familiar with classes and how to create them, I have added an extra video from one of my other courses: The Complete Web Developer: Zero to Mastery which goes over this topic in the next lecture.<br><br>If you are already familiar with this topic you can skip over to the<strong> Implementing An Array </strong>video. <br><br>Ps, throughout the course I use <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code> to declare variables.
